# Claude Code Instructions for Homelab Proxmox Project

This file contains ONLY workflow patterns, conventions, and enforcement rules. All project-specific information lives in `docs/` files.

## Documentation as Single Source of Truth

**CRITICAL RULE:** The `docs/` directory is the ONLY source of truth. NEVER duplicate information from docs/ files into this file or anywhere else.

### Source of Truth Files

Each file must stand alone and always be current:

- **`docs/HARDWARE.md`** - Physical hardware specifications, exact models, capabilities
- **`docs/NETWORK.md`** - Network architecture, VLANs, IP addressing, topology
- **`docs/SOFTWARE.md`** - Software stack, versions, application catalog
- **`docs/LINKS.md`** - Reference links and resources
- **`CLAUDE.md`** (this file) - Project plan, phases, todos, architecture decisions

### Documentation Update Rules

**YOU MUST:**
1. Always read the relevant docs/ file before making changes
2. Update docs/ files immediately when information changes
3. Keep docs/ files synchronized with reality
4. Update the appropriate file NOW, not later
5. Treat docs/ files as the contract between sessions
6. Validate no duplication exists between CLAUDE.md and docs/

**NEVER:**
- Duplicate information from docs/ into CLAUDE.md
- Reference outdated information
- Assume docs are current without checking
- Let docs drift from actual state

### When to Update Which File

- Hardware added/changed → `docs/HARDWARE.md`
- Network configuration changed → `docs/NETWORK.md`
- Software version updated → `docs/SOFTWARE.md`
- Plan/status changed → `CLAUDE.md`
- Architecture decision made → `CLAUDE.md`
- New link/resource found → `docs/LINKS.md`

**Rule:** If you're unsure which file, check the file descriptions above. If still unsure, ask.

## Core Workflow Patterns

### Start Every Session

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` "Current Status" section
2. Understand current phase and completed/pending tasks
3. Review open questions and information gaps
4. Check docs/ files as needed for context (hardware, network, software)

### Before Any Implementation

1. Document the plan in `CLAUDE.md` (update Project Phases)
2. Update relevant docs/ files with any new information learned
3. Identify and document any unknowns or decisions needed
4. Get user confirmation on approach

### During Work

1. Mark tasks as in-progress in `CLAUDE.md`
2. Update docs/ files as information is discovered
3. Document decisions and rationale in `CLAUDE.md`
4. Keep status current, not "will update later"

### After Completing Work

1. Mark tasks complete in `CLAUDE.md`
2. Update all relevant docs/ files
3. Validate single source of truth (no duplication between files)
4. Document any new open questions
5. Update "Last Updated" date in `CLAUDE.md`
6. **Log the interaction to `logs/prompts.log`**
7. **Commit changes to git with descriptive message**

## Prompt Logging Pattern

**MUST ALWAYS DO:** After each user prompt, append to `logs/prompts.log`

### Format
```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] User: "<user's prompt text>"
→ Response: <one-line summary of what was accomplished>

```

### Example
```
[2025-11-23 10:30:45] User: "help me plan homelab setup"
→ Response: Created planning structure with docs/ and CLAUDE.md

[2025-11-23 10:45:12] User: "move plans to CLAUDE.md"
→ Response: Moved plan/todos to CLAUDE.md, deleted docs/HOMELAB.md
```

### Rules
- Append timestamp + user prompt immediately when received
- Add response summary line when work is complete
- Keep summaries brief (one line, ~10-20 words)
- Add blank line between entries
- File is gitignored (personal log, not tracked)
- Never delete or modify existing entries (append-only)

## Git Commit Pattern

**MUST ALWAYS DO:** Commit changes after completing tasks or updating the plan

### When to Commit
- After completing a task or set of related tasks
- After updating `CLAUDE.md` with plan/status changes
- After making changes to docs/ files
- After infrastructure/code changes
- When a logical unit of work is complete

### Commit Message Format
```
<Short summary of changes>

<Optional detailed description>
- Bullet points for key changes
- List important decisions made
- Note any files created/modified

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Examples
```bash
# Simple commit
git commit -m "Add GPU passthrough documentation to HARDWARE.md"

# Detailed commit with HEREDOC
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Update CLAUDE.md with Phase 1 completion status

- Marked Proxmox installation tasks as complete
- Updated "Current Status" section
- Documented IOMMU configuration decisions
- Added open questions about storage strategy

)"
```

### Rules
- Always run `git add .` before committing (or stage specific files)
- Use descriptive commit messages (not "update" or "fix")
- Include Co-Authored-By attribution
- Don't commit `.envrc` or `logs/` (gitignored)
- Commit atomically (related changes together)

## Environment Variable Enforcement

**ABSOLUTE RULE:** NEVER hardcode configurable values.

### Pattern
- All secrets and config in `.envrc` (gitignored)
- Template maintained in `.envrc.example`
- Terraform uses `var.variable_name`
- Shell scripts use `${VARIABLE_NAME}`

### Enforcement
- Reject any PR/code with hardcoded IPs, passwords, URLs, or secrets
- Always suggest environment variable approach
- Document all required variables in `.envrc.example`
- If a value might change, it's a variable

## Repository Structure Convention

```
homelab-proxmox/
├── docs/                      # Source of truth (ALWAYS CURRENT)
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── terraform/            # Root Terraform configs
│   └── modules/              # Reusable Terraform modules
├── applications/             # Kubernetes apps (each has deploy.sh)
├── scripts/                  # Automation scripts
├── logs/                     # Interaction logs (gitignored)

├── README.md                # Project overview
└── CLAUDE.md               # This file (workflow + plan)
```

### Directory Conventions

- Each application in `applications/<name>/` has its own `deploy.sh`
- Terraform modules are reusable and parameterized
- Scripts in `scripts/` are for automation, not manual use
- All commands exposed via `Makefile` for consistency

## Makefile as Command Interface

**Pattern:** All operations go through `make` commands

```bash
make help          # Show available commands
make init          # Initialize Terraform
make plan          # Plan infrastructure changes
make apply         # Apply changes
make infra         # Full infrastructure deployment
make deploy APP=x  # Deploy specific application
```

Users should never need to remember terraform/kubectl/helm commands. The Makefile abstracts complexity.

## Application Deployment Pattern

**Convention:** Each app in `applications/<name>/` follows this pattern:

```
applications/<app-name>/
├── deploy.sh         # Deployment script (Helm install/upgrade)
├── values.yaml       # Helm values overrides
└── README.md         # App-specific docs
```

**Deployment script pattern:**
1. Check required environment variables
2. Create namespace if needed
3. Create secrets from environment variables
4. Deploy via Helm with `upgrade --install --atomic --cleanup-on-fail`
5. Verify deployment

## Reference Repository Usage

**Location:** `~/homelab-k3s`

**Purpose:** Inspiration for patterns ONLY, not code copying

**Use for:**
- Environment variable patterns
- Makefile structure concepts
- Deployment script patterns
- Documentation organization

**Do NOT:**
- Copy code directly
- Port XenOrchestra patterns to Proxmox
- Assume architecture decisions carry over
- Use without adapting to Proxmox context

## Things You MUST Remember

1. **Documentation First:** Plan in docs before implementing
2. **Docs Always Current:** Update docs/ files immediately when info changes
3. **No Hardcoding:** Everything configurable via environment variables
4. **Convention Over Configuration:** Use happy path solutions
5. **Clean Slate:** This is NOT a migration project
6. **Read Before Write:** Always read docs/ files before making changes
7. **Single Source of Truth:** docs/ files are the contract between sessions
8. **Validate Files:** Check no duplication between CLAUDE.md and docs/
9. **Log Every Prompt:** Append to `logs/prompts.log` after each interaction
10. **Commit After Tasks:** Create git commit when tasks are completed or plan is updated
11. **Skills Local:** Install skills to `.claude/` not `~/.claude/`

## Project Context

- **What:** Proxmox-based homelab with K3s and GPU passthrough
- **Status:** Planning Phase
- **Reference Repo:** `~/homelab-k3s` (patterns only, not migration)

## Architecture Decisions

### Cluster Topology
**Decision:** 2 control plane nodes + 1 GPU worker node

**Rationale:**
- Control plane on pve-node-02 and pve-node-03 (no GPU needed)
- Worker with GPU on pve-node-01 (dedicated for AI/ML)
- Allows control plane HA while maximizing GPU node resources
- 3 nodes provides proper quorum for embedded etcd

### K3s Datastore
**Decision:** Embedded etcd (not external database)

**Rationale:**
- Simpler setup than external MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Recommended for 3+ node clusters
- No additional database VM needed
- Better performance for small clusters

### GPU Passthrough Strategy
**Decision:** Pass entire RTX 4000 Ada to a single VM, run K3s agent in that VM

**Rationale:**
- Cleaner than container GPU passthrough
- Better driver compatibility
- Easier troubleshooting
- Can still use NVIDIA device plugin in K3s
- Alternative: Could use Proxmox LXC with GPU, but VM is more flexible

### Network Segmentation
**Decision:** Use existing VLAN infrastructure, homelab on VLAN 11 (VM-Servers, 10.20.11.0/24)

**Rationale:**
- Network already properly segmented with VLANs (10, 11, 12, 13)
- VLAN 11 (VM-Servers) dedicated to homelab infrastructure
- Provides isolation from other network segments
- Layer 3 switching enables secure inter-VLAN routing
- VPN provides additional security boundary for remote access
- Proxmox VLAN-aware bridges allow flexible VM networking
- Good security posture without additional complexity

**Existing VLAN Structure:**
- VLAN 10: Core-Infrastructure (10.20.10.0/24) - network equipment
- VLAN 11: VM-Servers (10.20.11.0/24) - **homelab primary**
- VLAN 12: Personal (10.20.12.0/24) - personal devices
- VLAN 13: IoT (10.20.13.0/24) - IoT devices (accessible via K8s ingress)

### Storage Strategy
**Decision:** Local-lvm for VMs, UNAS Pro (NFS) for K8s PVs, Synology (NFS) for backups

**Rationale:**
- **Local-lvm**: Fast VM disk performance on each node
- **UNAS Pro (nas.home.arpa)**: Primary NFS storage for ISOs, templates, K8s persistent volumes, shared data (40TB usable, 10GbE, RAID 5)
- **Synology (synology.home.arpa)**: Dedicated backup target for Proxmox VMs, etcd snapshots, critical configs (6TB usable, RAID 1, separate device for redundancy)
- **Separation of concerns**: Production storage separate from backup storage
- **No Ceph**: Complexity not justified for 3 nodes
- **Protocols**: NFS for simplicity (SMB remains for Mac Time Machine backups)

### GitOps Tool
**Decision:** FluxCD

**Rationale:**
- Lightweight and Git-native (true GitOps)
- Simpler than ArgoCD for homelab scale
- Well-documented for K3s
- Can migrate to ArgoCD later if UI/features needed
- Fits "simplicity first" approach

### LoadBalancer Service
**Decision:** MetalLB in Layer 2 mode

**Rationale:**
- Most mature and popular for K3s bare metal
- Simple IP pool configuration (10.20.11.200-220)
- Layer 2 mode works out of the box
- Can upgrade to BGP mode later with Enterprise switch Layer 3 capabilities
- Large community and extensive documentation

### TLS Certificates
**Decision:** Let's Encrypt with DNS-01 challenge via Cloudflare

**Rationale:**
- Free, trusted certificates (no browser warnings)
- Wildcard cert for `*.lab.codeofficer.com`
- DNS-01 challenge doesn't require public exposure
- Cloudflare free tier includes API access
- cert-manager handles automatic renewal
- Services accessible only via VPN but with valid certs

**Configuration:**
- Domain: codeofficer.com (migrate from DNSimple to Cloudflare)
- Subdomain: `*.lab.codeofficer.com` points to internal IPs
- Local DNS: `*.home.arpa` managed by UDM Pro

### Monitoring Strategy
**Decision:** Deploy Prometheus + Grafana in Phase 4+ (deferred)

**Rationale:**
- Start simple, add monitoring once cluster is stable
- Proxmox has built-in monitoring for infrastructure
- `kubectl top` sufficient for initial workloads
- Easy to add later (just Helm charts)
- Focus on core functionality first

### Naming Conventions
**Decision:**
- Local hostnames: `*.home.arpa` (RFC 8375 compliant)
- Public DNS: `*.lab.codeofficer.com`
- Node naming: Short and consistent (pve-01, pve-02, pve-03)

**Rationale:**
- `home.arpa` is the standard for home networks
- Avoids conflicts with `.local` (mDNS)
- `.lab` subdomain clearly identifies homelab services
- Short node names easier to type and remember

### VM Resource Allocation
**Decision:**
- Control plane nodes: 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 50GB disk
- GPU worker node: 8 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 100GB disk

**Rationale:**
- Leaves plenty of headroom on 96GB nodes
- Control plane can handle moderate workload
- GPU node sized for AI/ML workloads
- Can adjust resources later if needed

---

## Information Still Needed

✅ **Phase 0 Complete - All critical information collected**

### Optional Future Information
- [ ] Specific application resource requirements (determined during Phase 5)
- [ ] External ingress requirements per application (determined during deployment)
- [ ] Detailed data persistence needs per application (determined during deployment)

---

## Open Questions

✅ **All architectural questions resolved during Phase 0**

### Decisions Made:
1. **Storage:** ✅ NFS from UNAS Pro for K8s PVs, local-lvm for VM disks
2. **Backups:** ✅ Synology (separate device for backup target)
3. **DNS:** ✅ UDM Pro built-in DNS + Cloudflare for public DNS
4. **Certificates:** ✅ Let's Encrypt with DNS-01 challenge
5. **Monitoring:** ✅ Defer to Phase 4+ (start simple)
6. **GPU Workloads:** ✅ Ollama, Stable Diffusion WebUI, Jupyter Lab
7. **LoadBalancer:** ✅ MetalLB Layer 2 mode
8. **GitOps:** ✅ FluxCD
9. **Network:** ✅ Use existing VLAN 11 (VM-Servers, 10.20.11.0/24) for homelab

## Notes

- Reference repository: `~/homelab-k3s` (for patterns and inspiration only)
- This is a CLEAN SLATE build, not a migration
- Keep `docs/` files updated as single source of truth
- Use conventional solutions (happy path) over custom implementations
- Document all decisions and rationale in this file

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Duplicating hardware specs (use `docs/HARDWARE.md`)
❌ Duplicating network details (use `docs/NETWORK.md`)
❌ Duplicating software versions (use `docs/SOFTWARE.md`)
❌ Documenting decisions in commit messages instead of CLAUDE.md
❌ Saying "I'll update later" (update NOW)
❌ Assuming docs are current without checking
❌ Hardcoding values "temporarily" (never temporary)
❌ Installing skills globally to `~/.claude/` (use `.claude/`)
❌ Skipping file validation after updates

## File Update Validation Checklist

After updating CLAUDE.md or docs/ files, verify:
- [ ] No information duplicated between CLAUDE.md and docs/
- [ ] Hardware specs only in `docs/HARDWARE.md`
- [ ] Network config only in `docs/NETWORK.md`
- [ ] Software versions only in `docs/SOFTWARE.md`
- [ ] Architecture decisions in CLAUDE.md reference docs/ when needed
- [ ] Each file can stand alone and be understood independently

## This File's Purpose

CLAUDE.md exists to:
- Track project plan, phases, todos, and status
- Document architecture decisions with rationale
- Enforce workflow patterns and conventions
- Define directory structure and code patterns
- Maintain information gaps and open questions

docs/ files exist to:
- Hardware specs (`docs/HARDWARE.md`)
- Network config (`docs/NETWORK.md`)
- Software catalog (`docs/SOFTWARE.md`)
- Reference links (`docs/LINKS.md`)

## Workflow Enforcement Primitives

To ensure consistent workflow compliance, this project uses a combination of three Claude Code primitives:

### 1. Hook: `user-prompt-submit-hook`

**Location:** `.claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit-hook`

**Purpose:** Automatic workflow checks after each user prompt

**What it checks:**
- Uncommitted changes (reminds to commit after completing work)
- Missing prompt logs (verifies today's date appears in logs/prompts.log)
- Outdated CLAUDE.md Last Updated date (checks if > 1 day old)
- Hardcoded secrets in staged changes

**Output:** Lightweight warnings and reminders, suggests running `/validate` for deep check

### 2. Slash Command: `/validate`

**Location:** `.claude/commands/validate.md`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive workflow validation on-demand

**What it validates:**
1. Documentation compliance (single source of truth)
2. Prompt logging completeness
3. Git status and uncommitted changes
4. Phase tracking and status currency
5. Environment variable usage
6. File structure compliance
7. Workflow pattern adherence

**Output:** Structured report with PASS/WARN/FAIL status, offers to fix issues

### 3. Skill: `homelab-workflow`

**Location:** `.claude/skills/homelab-workflow/`

**Purpose:** AI-powered workflow enforcement and automatic fixes

**Core capabilities:**
1. **Documentation Compliance** - AI reads CLAUDE.md and docs/ files to detect content duplication (not just keywords)
2. **Prompt Logging** - Ensures all interactions logged correctly
3. **Git Commit Validation** - Checks for uncommitted work and generates proper commit messages
4. **CLAUDE.md Status Updates** - Keeps phase tracking and status current
5. **Environment Variable Scanning** - Flags hardcoded values
6. **TodoWrite Compliance** - Ensures proper task tracking

**Smart Features:**
- Automatically discovers new docs/ files
- Distinguishes mentions from duplication (AI understands context)
- Can apply fixes automatically
- Adapts to changes in project structure

**Usage:** Invoke when completing tasks, updating docs, or when validation needed

### Using the Primitives Together

**Normal workflow:**
1. Hook runs automatically after each prompt (lightweight checks)
2. User runs `/validate` periodically for deep validation
3. AI invokes `homelab-workflow` skill when fixing violations

**When to use each:**
- **Hook** → Always (automatic)
- **`/validate`** → When you want comprehensive validation report
- **Skill** → When intelligent fixes or content analysis needed

## Skills Installation Pattern

**CRITICAL:** When installing skills, ALWAYS use project-local `.claude/` directory

### Pattern
```bash
# CORRECT: Install to project .claude/ folder
claude skill add <skill-name> --local

# WRONG: Don't install to global ~/.claude/
claude skill add <skill-name>
```

### Rules
- Skills go in `.claude/skills/` within this project
- Never install skills globally to `~/.claude/`
- Project-specific skills stay with project
- Commit `.claude/` directory to git (except secrets)

### Why
- Skills are project-specific tools
- Keep project self-contained
- Other developers/sessions get same skills
- No pollution of global environment
