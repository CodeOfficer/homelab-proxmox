# AGENTS

This project uses a lightweight, app-scoped plan. Treat this file as the entry point for any new session.

## Where to find the plan

- Active plan: `applications/spotify/PLAN.md`

## Plan lifecycle (required)

- Active work lives in `applications/spotify/PLAN.md`.
- When a plan is superseded or completed, archive it to `docs/plan-archive/spotify-YYYY-MM.md`.
- Add a short "History" entry in `applications/spotify/PLAN.md` linking to the archive.
- Plans are not archived automatically; do it explicitly when the plan changes.

## Documentation rule (required)

- Only add or update guidance/notes in `applications/spotify/AGENTS.md` or `applications/spotify/PLAN.md`. Do not edit other docs for this kind of content.

## Working conventions

- Run Spotify app commands from `applications/spotify` unless stated otherwise.
